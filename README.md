## Network Bias Detection Net

The goal of this project is to develop a neural network capable to measuring the biases of other networks without necessarily having access to the datasets they would apply to.

For testing purposes, we are making use of the Communities and Crime Dataset from https://uwyomachinelearning.github.io/ (original source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/communities+and+crime)

## RaMoGen

Random Model Generator is a supplemental program used to create random models for training and testing purposes.
