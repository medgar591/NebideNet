## Preliminary Information

Here is where I will put notes and code intended to make sure the rest of this document functions properly.
```{r}
getwd()
```


## Randomly Generated Models

One important part of generating models is testing their biases. Here is a set of data based on models generated to work with the Community Crime Dataset.

```{r}
data.df <- read.csv("testStats.csv")
head(data)
```

To start with, here is a dotplot that shows the intersections between positive results (Crime Predicted) based on having or not having the sensitive attribute (Being a Minority Community).

```{r}
with(data.df, plot(PgNS~PgS, ylab= "Positive rate of Non-Sensitive groups", xlab="Positive rate of Sensitive groups"))
```
